# [Title] - Stub Request

<!--
STUB FILE TEMPLATE
==================
Use this template for lightweight requests that point to external sources.
Stubs are ideal when:
- The main content exists elsewhere (files, URLs)
- You need simple transformations or summaries
- Instructions are straightforward

For complex tasks with detailed requirements, use request.md template instead.
